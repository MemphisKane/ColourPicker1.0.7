# ColourPicker1.0.7 — Color Picker for Encycolorpedia

**ColourPicker1.0.7** is a Chrome/Edge extension that lets you sample any pixel’s HEX via the EyeDropper API, then immediately opens Encycolorpedia and isolates the **Similar Paints** section on a clean black background—no ads, no distractions.
